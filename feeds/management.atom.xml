professional relationships, I've found that the best apologies have the
following 4 parts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"What I did I was wrong"&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I messed up when I ..."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I understand how this would cause you to feel ..."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"In the future, I'm going to ..."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This format has a few subtle points in it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I was wrong" is an explicit admission of guilt and forces me to be
   sincere. It makes the apology much more effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is important to be specific about &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; behavior was wrong. This
   specificity allows me to demonstrate that I listened by describing my
   behavior from their perspective. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is super powerful to reflect the person's emotion back to them. Again,
   this is an opportunity to demonstrate listening; this &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; shows that I
   think their reaction was valid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing a short description of my corrective actions shows
   that I am taking responsibility for my behavior by providing an
   &lt;em&gt;unconditional&lt;/em&gt; commitment to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is relatively short, which makes it easy to remember and harder to drag
   out a potentially emotional process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put all together, an apology might sound like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I'm sorry, I was wrong to shout at you in that fight. I understand how
   that made your feel scared. In the future, I'm going to take a few deep
   breaths to calm down."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I'm sorry about that meeting. I was wrong to report your status as red
   without giving you warning; I bet it made you feel bad in front of your
   boss. In the future, I'll try to give you a heads up so you can have
   some time to prepared."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there are a lot of ways I used to accidentally screw up apologies.
Here are some apology tips:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I explained 'why' I acted that way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying "the reason why", "What I was thinking", "my intent was", or "because"
   is the fastest way to ruin the apology by making it about me, not them.
   Worse, it can make it seem like I am attempting to absolve myself of
   my mistake. 
   Instead, I find its better to say "It doesn't matter why I did that, I
   know it still made you feel ..."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I mentioned the other's behavior in my apology.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying "I was wrong
   to raise my voice when you ..." is too close to offering an excuse (see the
   previous point).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I waited for them to be ready to apologize&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I let a few important
   relationships sour because I was "right" and was waiting for the other
   person to apologize first.
   Instead, I try to apologize as soon as I am ready for &lt;em&gt;my part&lt;/em&gt;: the actions
   that I genuinely acknowledge were hurtful, ineffective, etc. Here, being
   specific about my behavior during the apology helps me be genuine. For
   example, "I was wrong to raise my voice".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I apologized for their reaction, not my behavior&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"I was wrong to make you
   upset" or "I'm sorry that you got upset" are both missing the description
   of &lt;em&gt;my actions&lt;/em&gt; that provoked that reaction. Instead, I try to explicitly
   refer
   to my behavior: "I was wrong to shout" or "I was wrong to use a high
   pitched tone of voice."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I qualifed the apology&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saying "I'm sorry if ..." or "in the future, I
   will ... if ..." similarly indicates only conditional acceptance of responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I apologized in writing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a conversation where emotions
   matter; I now do it in the most personal channel I have available (in
   person &amp;gt; video call &amp;gt; phone call).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my favorite apology resources, that were inspirational for
this post:&lt;/p&gt;
