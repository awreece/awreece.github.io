&lt;h2&gt;An overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is basically an extended doctoral thesis, written in 1996. It
discusses how employees are motivated by measurement, in particular focussing
on incentives that lead to disfunctional behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is dense and a bit self-indulgent, but has a few fascinating points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Types of measurements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin first points out that there are two different types of measurements,
&lt;em&gt;motivational&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;informational&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motivational measurement is, by definition, intended to cause reactions in the people being measured, while informational measurement should be careful not to change the actions of the people being measured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This distinction is only useful when talking about the intent of measurement;
he very quickly points out that if human beings are aware of the fact that they
are being measured, they will invariably change the motivations based on the
numbers. That is to say, there is no such thing as informational measures for
humans:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike mechanisms and organisms, organizations have subcomponents that realize they are being measured&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worse, this leads to the compromise of the measures:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desire to be viewed favorably provides an incentive for people being measured to tailor, supplement, repackage, and censor information that flows upward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A model for employee motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin lays out a model for motivation with 3 parties, a customer, a principal
(or boss), and an agent (or employee). The agent has two types of tasks to work
on (e.g. cooking and cleaning or quantity and quality, etc) and must allocate 
time between them. The customer has a preference for the ratio of allocations 
between the two tasks (e.g. 40% cooking and 60% cleaning). The boss is
trying to figure out how to motivate the employee to do more work; 
the motivation system is considered to be &lt;em&gt;dysfunctional&lt;/em&gt; if the 
agent does not follow the customers preferred ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This model is a great framework for making key observations:
 - If the boss only incentivizes one of the two tasks, the employee will 
   natually do primarily that task and little of the other, leading to 
   dysfunction. &lt;em&gt;This is the key reason for dysfunction in organizations&lt;/em&gt;, 
   when not all of the &lt;em&gt;critical tasks&lt;/em&gt; are incentivized. If a motivation
   scheme misses a task important to a customer or if a dimension is hard to 
   measure (e.g. measuring quality), the system is doomed to by dysfunctional.
 - If you assume the employee is motivated by the desire to do a good job
   by pleasing the customer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; knows what the customer wants,
   then they will naturally seek out an allocation of time to tasks that 
   makes the customer happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Austin's Unsatisfying Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin clearly suggests that the best way to motivate employees is via internal
motivation, of doing a good job and supporting a team. He talks about a few
cultures that do this well (e.g. Japanese manufacturing), but doesn't give a
very compelling way to motivate employees to output more work -- increasing
compensation as a function of measured output would do so, but he clearly
indicates that he thinks it is impossible to measure output without
dysfunction. Worse, he thinks that providing external motivation usually ruins
an employee's internal motivation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One last interesting quote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers verbalize only the most direct of three categories of desires when asked (see, for example, Hauser and Clausing, 1988). Customers do not mention needs that they assume will be met by all products of the type in question. And they do not mention product qualities that they have not thought of but would like. They mention only qualities that they do not expect but know that they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Opinion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the key takeways of the book are the two insights derived from the models:
 - Measuring output will necessarily be disfunctional if any important
   dimension is not measured.
 - Employees internal desire to do good work will cause them to natually choose
   an ideal allocation of labor, assuming they have perfect knowledge of what
   the customer wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this last assumption is critical -- most organizations try to silo
knowledge about the customer in a product management role. I think this
assumption is a key reason why &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; employees (e.g. engineers) should be
expected to understand customer goals and information should be actively spread
to them; in my opinion, the role of product should be to disseminate information
so that all engineers can make good allocations.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="opinion"></category></entry><entry><title>A review of Winning with Data</title><link href="http://codearcana.com/posts/2018/04/11/a-review-of-winning-with-data.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-04-11T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2018-04-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Alex Reece</name></author><id>tag:codearcana.com,2018-04-11:/posts/2018/04/11/a-review-of-winning-with-data.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the advice of a former colleague, I recently read &lt;a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Winning-Data-Transform-Culture-Empower-ebook/dp/B01G9FLALC"&gt;Winning with Data: Transform Your Culture, Empower Your People, and Shape the Future&lt;/a&gt; by Tomasz Tunguz and Frank Bien.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book was a bunch of just-so stories about how companies used a data-driven methodology (via Looker) to improve their business. It also mixed in some unrelated stuff; e.g. how to do pitches. I found this quite underwhelming, but here were some interesting quotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Quotes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brutal intellectual honesty aims to slay the HIPPO, or the highest-paid person's opinion, as the determining factor of the direction of a project, team, or company. Left unmitigated, this management artifact wreaks disastrous consequences on companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is particularly relevant to companies that try to bring a more data driven approach to decision making and might have to counter traditional decision making. I think this was a place where there was a lot of potential for more interesting exploration: how do you convince a team to switch to a data driven culture (e.g. the old school scouts in Moneyball).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What decisions would that analysis inform?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When being asked to do some involved/length analysis, make sure the result would have real business impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upworthy's use of attention minutes, rather than the traditional cost per thousand impressions, as a metric for charging advertisers aligns the incentives of readers, journalists, and advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of derived measures here reminds me of the use of “risk tolerance” by the google SRE teams https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/embracing-risk.html&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Z score is determined by the desired p-value / confidence interval. Let's choose an 80 percent confidence interval. The Z score is 1.28.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standard of deviation is measured on a scale from 0 to 1. Most people use 0.5 since it is the most forgiving value and will generate the largest sample size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The margin of error is also called the confidence interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ SampleSize = \frac{ZScore^2 * StandardOfDeviation * (1 -
StandardOfDeviation)}{MarginOfError^2} $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A convenient formula to compute required sample size for a statistically
relevant study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their analysis showed 10 slides is the optimal length for fundraising pitches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Company Purpose&lt;/em&gt;: the mission or goal of the business&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Problem&lt;/em&gt;: the complication with the status quo that creates the opportunity for the business to pursue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solution&lt;/em&gt;: the company's proposed idea to resolve the problem&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why Now&lt;/em&gt;: why should this idea succeed now, when no one has succeeded with it before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Market Size&lt;/em&gt;: if the business were to succeed, how valuable could it be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Product&lt;/em&gt;: typically, a demonstration of the product or images of the technology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Team&lt;/em&gt;: the members of the founding and executive team, often including key advisors and investors&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Model&lt;/em&gt;: an overview of the business' pricing strategy and unit economics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Competition&lt;/em&gt;: a description of the alternatives and substitutes and how the startup intends to differentiate itself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Financials&lt;/em&gt;: a pro-forma profit and loss projection of the business. In Docsend's analysis, investors spend the most time on this slide to understand the long-term profitability of the business and the amount of capital required to sustain the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this list of 10 slides is likely to be good for nearly any pitch, including for internal presentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="opinion"></category></entry><entry><title>A review of Drift Into Failure</title><link href="http://codearcana.com/posts/2016/03/02/a-review-of-drift-into-failure.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-03-02T00:00:00-08:00</published><updated>2016-03-02T00:00:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Alex Reece</name></author><id>tag:codearcana.com,2016-03-02:/posts/2016/03/02/a-review-of-drift-into-failure.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the advice of a former colleague, I recently read &lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/Drift-into-Failure-Components-Understanding-ebook/dp/B009KOKXKY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Drift into Failure: From Hunting Broken Components to Understanding Complex Systems&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Sidney Dekker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;An overview of &lt;em&gt;Drift into Failure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By examining several recent disasters (ranging from the Challenger explosion to the housing market collapse of 2008), Dekker contends that root cause analysis is an inherently flawed strategy for understanding failures of large complicated systems (e.g. the NASA bureaucracy or Wall Street). Dekker believes that a single faulty component cannot be held to blame for these failures. Competing pressures (e.g. budget, publicity) can allow complicated systems to tolerate increasing levels of risk over time, leading to a slow "drift into failure" where no one component can be held truly responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dekker eventually proposes several ways to avoid this drift. He says that "high reliability organizations" tend to exhibit the following 4 characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Senior management commitment to safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shared care and concern for hazards and a willingness to learn and understand how they impact people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realistic and flexible norms and rules about hazards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continual reflection on practice through monitoring, analysis, and feedback systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last point is the most nuanced. Since organizations will evolve over time, it is important that they continually reflect on how they are changing to ensure they evolve in the best direction for the long term health of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This kind of reflection is &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt; for most organizations and Dekker offers some interesting suggestions for how to do it. First, he emphasizes that senior management must support this kind reflection and commitment. He then suggests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rotating personnel from different places (but similar operations) for shorter periods can in principle be done in a variety of worlds. It represents an important lever for assuring the kind of diversity that can make small steps visible and open for discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During these discussions, Dekker says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The questions we should reflect on (even if we may not get clear answers) are two-fold: why did this happen, and why are we surprised that it happened? The first question is about the workings of the complex system and its environment. The second is about our (lack of) understanding of those workings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, Dekker recommends that organizations give authority to all levels of an organization. He cites the example of the nuclear aircraft carrier:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the lowest ranking individual on the deck of an aircraft carrier has the authority (and in indeed the duty) to suspend immediately any take-off or landing that might pose unnecessary risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, he suggests that systems can use this tendency to evolve to push themselves towards safety. Rather than compliance and regulation, he suggests that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;complex systems should have a co-evolver/counter evolver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an entity that is aware of the complexity of the organization (and will evolve with it) and strives to push the organization in a different direction than it would locally optimize for. Dekker doesn't mention it, but I think Netflix's &lt;a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/2012/07/chaos-monkey-released-into-wild.html"&gt;Chaos Monkey&lt;/a&gt; is the perfect example of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A wrap up&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the book was fascinating but hard to read. Unfortunately, Dekker uses very complex language that usually muddles his argument rather than refining it. This confusion was exacerbated by the fact that he only starts proposing solutions in the last chapter. I ended up writing this review because I wanted to share the ideas of the book with other people but wasn't convinced they would read through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Do startups have a moral imperative not to fail?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things that really struck me in the book was that it implicitly assumed that these systems had a moral imperative not to fail. For a mine or airline, where human lives are at stake, that case is "easier" to argue; however, I feel like that is not a core tenet of many web startups. In some sense, the motto "move fast break things" seems like a deliberate acknowledgment that there is no moral imperative to avoid failure.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="opinion"></category></entry></feed>
