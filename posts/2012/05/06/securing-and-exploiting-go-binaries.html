        <h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
First, I have been working in Go for about a year now. As part of this years pCTF, I created a problem that involved exploiting a Go binary (binary and source <a href="http://ppp.cylab.cmu.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bunyan-wp.tar.gz">here</a>). I consequently had to deal with securing the binary to prevent leaking unnecessary information and had some fun playing around with exploiting a Go binary.
</p>

<h3>Securing a Go Binary</h3>

<p>
Creating a secure, production-ready Go binary was more challenging than expected. By default: <ul>
    <li>The Go build tools include the full path to the source on the build machine in the binary. </li>
    <li>Go binaries helpfully print the faulting address and instruction on segmentation faults.</li>
    <li>The heap in Go is loaded at a fixed address and is executable.</li>
    <li>Go binaries are linked with full debug information.</li>
</ul>
I filed a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=3467">issue</a> suggesting the option for a compiler flag to create a hardended binary, but there has not been much interest in that yet.
</p>

<p>
Some of these problems can be mitigated with appropriate hacks. The path to the Go runtime can be changed by setting the environment variable <tt>GOROOT_FINAL</tt> before running <tt>all.bash</tt> (see <a href="http://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=3467#c4">this comment</a> on the issue I filed). For user code, it takes some more work: I had to deep copy all of my source into a <tt>/tmp/build</tt> directory before compiling so that the only string was a <tt>"/tmp/build"</tt> rather than the actual path.
</p>

<p>
Some debug information can be stripped by passing <tt>-s</tt> as a command line to the linker (for example, <tt>go build -ldflags "-s" prog.go</tt>). Note that this does not remove file paths, etc from the binary. It is pretty easy to patch the Go runtime to avoid printing the faulting address and instruction, but that should probably take the form of a real change rather than a quick and dirty patch. Unfortunately, the heap to be seems executable and loaded into fixed location by design (so that closures are easier and that heap addresses do not overlap with valid unicode strings, making the garbage collector easier), so it is not clear that that will be fixed for anytime soon.
</p>

<h3>Exploiting a Go program</h3>

<h4>Disclaimer</h4>

<p>
First things first - I did <em>not</em> find an exploit in the Go runtime that gave code execution. Instead, I linked the Go binary to a cgo library that had an intentional vulnerability. I had to do some work to make the cgo library exploitable. I made an explicitly vulnerabile C program and specified flags <tt>-fno-stack-protector -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE</tt> to discard modern protections. Lastly, the behavior I performed in cgo (printing a string to stdout) could have trivially been perfomed in pure Go.
</p>

<p>
However, I personally feel like Go packages use the unsafe package or are linked against full C libraries commonly enough (consider banthars <a href="https://github.com/banthar/gl">package</a> with Go bindings for OpenGl or a <a href="http://go-lang.cat-v.org/library-bindings">variety</a> of other packages) that it is irresponsible for the Go runtime to be poorly secured out of the claim that there are no vulnerabilies in Go. Furthermore, the Go runtime should be better secured to avoid the damage from any as of yet undiscovered vulnerabilities in the Go runtime.
</p>

<p>
Going forward, I will assume that there is a vulnerability (introduced possibly by a vulnerable C library) and will focus on one interesting way to exploit it by using the Go runtime. I will specifically focus on the <a href="webapp"><tt>webapp</tt></a> problem used in pCTF.
</p>

<h4>The actual exploit</h4>

<p>
The Go runtime has some really interesting properties that make it fun to exploit:
<ul>
    <li>The heap is executable.</li>
    <li>The heap is deterministic and in a fixed location every run</li>
    <li>Immutable strings tend to end up on the heap</li>
</ul>
We will construct an exploit that takes advantage of all of these properties. First, we get get a vulnerability that gives us a crash.

<p>We run our exploit again, and then search the heap for our string (we know that the heap is always in the range <tt>[0x18600000, 0x18900000]</tt> for this binary since Go has a deterministic heap).</p>

<p>So now we know that our string, which is <tt>:AAAA...AAAABBBB</tt>, is located at <tt>0x1883cd7b - 4 - 109 = 0x1883cd0e</tt> on the heap.

<p><p>
Success!
</p>
<h3>Postmortem</h3>
<p>
This exploit is interesting for a number of reasons. First of all, it works on any (32 bit) machine running the same version of Go as the attacker. This is because heap allocations end up being quite deterministic. Next, this type of exploit (jump to an object on the executable heap, such as a string put there via a string concatenation) is something that would be easy to replicate in a variety of Go binaries. Lastly, the executable heap offers an easy surface for heap sprays and other attacks. It is also easy to imagine an expoit that uses a heap overwrite to clobber a closure and get code execution.
</p></p>
<p>
It is also important to note that, while the vulnerability is introduced through C code, common C protections such as NX, ASLR, and libc randomization would make this binary very difficult to exploit without the use of the weak Go runtime. I wish to repeat: <em>this binary is easily exploitable because it is a Go binary</em>, even assuming ASLR, NX, and libc randomization.
</p>

<p>
I firmly believe that Go should consider randomizing its heap and making it no longer executable. I also think that it is imperative to provide a compiler option that hardens the binary by disabling the printing of debugging information (stack traces, faulting addresses) on program crashes and stripping debugging / package information from the binary. 
</p>

<h3>Go Community Response</h3>

<p>
For anyone who is interested, the Go community's response is <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/golang-nuts/browse_thread/thread/25df6d94d73a8d41">here</a>. In summary: vulnerabilities in Go are extremely unlikely so the engineering/complexity overhead required to implement any of these protections is not worth it. I respectfully disagree - vulnerabilities can come from cgo libraries or from as of yet unknown bugs in the Go runtime itself. Furthermore, I suspect that adding ASLR or NX would not require very much effort.
</p>

<h3>Other writeups</h3>

<p>
There are writeups of this problem available by:
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://eindbazen.net/2012/05/plaid-ctf-2012-bunyan/">Eindbazen</a> (C style return to libc exploit)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.bases-hacking.org/bunyan-plaidctf2012.html">w3stormz</a> (Go heap exploit, in French)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>tl;dr</h3>

<p>
Go binaries are compiled with a lot of debug info, which some people might want to strip. The Go heap is executable and deterministic, making the exploitation of the pCTF Bunyan problem relatively straightforward.
