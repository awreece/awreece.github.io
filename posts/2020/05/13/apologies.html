        <h2>4 parts of an apology</h2>
<p>I've been thinking about apologies recently. In both personal and
professional relationships, I've found that the best apologies have the
following 4 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>"What I did I was wrong"</li>
<li>"I messed up when I ..."</li>
<li>"I understand how this would cause you to feel ..."</li>
<li>"In the future, I'm going to ..."</li>
</ul>
<p>This format has a few subtle points in it:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I was wrong" is an explicit admission of guilt and forces me to be
   sincere. It makes the apology much more effective.</li>
<li>It is important to be specific about <em>what</em> behavior was wrong. This
   specificity allows me to demonstrate that I listened by describing my
   behavior from their perspective. </li>
<li>It is super powerful to reflect the person's emotion back to them. Again,
   this is an opportunity to demonstrate listening; this <em>also</em> shows that I
   think their reaction was valid.</li>
<li>Providing a short description of my corrective actions shows
   that I am taking responsibility for my behavior by providing an
   <em>unconditional</em> commitment to change.</li>
<li>It is relatively short, which makes it easy to remember and harder to drag
   out a potentially emotional process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Some sample apologies</h2>
<p>Put all together, an apology might sound like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>"I'm sorry, I was wrong to shout at you in that fight. I understand how
   that made your feel scared. In the future, I'm going to take a few deep
   breaths to calm down."</li>
<li>"I'm sorry about that meeting. I was wrong to report your status as red in
   front of your boss without discussing you first; I bet it made you feel
   frustrated. In the future, I'll make sure to sync up with you about the
   status beforehand."</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to screw up an apology</h2>
<p>But there are a lot of ways I used to accidentally screw up apologies:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>I explained 'why' I acted that way.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Saying "the reason why", "What I was thinking", "my intent was", or "because"
   is the fastest way to ruin the apology by making it about me, not them.
   Worse, it can make it seem like I am attempting to absolve myself of
   my mistake. 
   Instead, I find its better to say "It doesn't matter why I did that, I
   know it still made you feel ..."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I mentioned the other's behavior in my apology.</em> </p>
<ul>
<li>Saying "I was wrong
   to raise my voice when you ..." is too close to offering an excuse (see the
   previous point).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I waited for them to be ready to apologize</em>. </p>
<ul>
<li>I let a few important
   relationships sour because I was "right" and was waiting for the other
   person to apologize first.
   Instead, I try to apologize as soon as I am ready for <em>my part</em>: the actions
   that I genuinely acknowledge were hurtful, ineffective, etc. Here, being
   specific about my behavior during the apology helps me be genuine. For
   example, "I was wrong to raise my voice".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I apologized for their reaction, not my behavior</em>. </p>
<ul>
<li>"I was wrong to make you
   upset" or "I'm sorry that you got upset" are both missing the description
   of <em>my actions</em> that provoked that reaction. Instead, I try to explicitly
   refer
   to my behavior: "I was wrong to shout" or "I was wrong to use a high
   pitched tone of voice."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I qualifed the apology</em>. </p>
<ul>
<li>Saying "I'm sorry if ..." or "in the future, I
   will ... if ..." similarly indicates only conditional acceptance of responsibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>I apologized in writing.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a conversation where emotions
   matter; I now do it in the most personal channel I have available (in
   person &gt; video call &gt; phone call).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

this post:</p>
