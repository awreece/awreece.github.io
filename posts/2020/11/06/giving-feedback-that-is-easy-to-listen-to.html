        <p>The whole point of feedback is to change someone’s behavior in the future. That only works if you can give it in a form that they can listen to. This is a template I got from the wonderful Manager Tools on how to give feedback in a way that maximizes the chance that your feedback will be heard.</p>
<h2>Use the "When you {verb}ed ... what happened was ..." model</h2>
<h3>"When you"</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify the externally visible past behavior, not mindset or intent.</li>
<li>You should be so descriptive (or so recent to the event) that they can identify a specific instance of them exhibiting the behavior</li>
<li>Deliberately force yourself to give feedback about only specific instances and not patterns – it will force you to give feedback that is easier to listen to.</li>
</ul>
<h3>"What happened was"</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identify impact in the context of the event</li>
<li>Great feedback uses impact that resonates with the listener, e.g. "the project delivered late" vs "Tim was sad" are valued differently by different people on the team.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>"<em><strong>When you</strong></em> added an emoji to my slack message, <em><strong>what happened was</strong></em> I felt I was part of a team"</li>
<li>"<em><strong>When you</strong></em> interrupted me when I was talking about API design in the team meeting, <em><strong>what happened was</strong></em> I stopped offering my perspective during the discussion"</li>
<li>"<em><strong>When you</strong></em> provided an alternative doc comment in my code review, <em><strong>what happened was</strong></em> it was easy for me to incorporate the change"</li>
</ul>
<h2>Subtle failure modes</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>"You come off as mean; for example, you interrupted me"</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Providing feedback of the form "pattern example" is especially dangerous, since it can create a story that is hard to recover from. (If the person stops interrupting, are they still mean?).</li>
<li>Instead, prefer the form "instance consequence", so it is more clear that changing the behavior will change the effect: <em>"When you interrupted me, you came off as an asshole"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>"When you started speaking while I was speaking, what happened was I felt insulted"</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Impact on your emotions is ok, but some words can accidentally ascribe intent (did the person intend to insult you?).</li>
<li>Instead, prefer words that describe your emotional state (for examples, check out <a href="https://www.cnvc.org/training/resource/feelings-inventory">this list</a>): <em>"When you started speaking while I was speaking, what happened was I felt angry"</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>"When you interrupt me, what happens is I stop speaking"</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Giving feedback in present tense usually is about a pattern and is generally less credible; its easy for someone to say "I didn't do that" or "I stopped doing that" or "you only notice bad things", etc.</li>
<li>Instead, use past tense and prefer feedback about specific examples: <em>"When you interrupted me in the team meeting, what happened is I stopped speaking"</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get the right context</h2>
<p>Manager Tools warns (rightly) that it is very dangerous to give feedback when
you can't be sure the other person knows its coming from a place of love:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wait until you have a strong relationship to give feedback.</li>
<li>Avoid doing it when angry.</li>
<li>Aim to do it with a laugh and a wry smile on your face.</li>
<li>Avoid doing it in writing, where people have to infer emotions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Further reading</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/">Manager Tools</a> is chock-full of great advice
  on feedback (and other management duties). I highly recommend starting from
  <a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics">the basics</a> and checking out podcasts like
  <a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/giving-effective-feedback">The Feedback Model</a> or
  <a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/2006/02/improve-your-feedback">Improve your feedback with DISC</a> or
  <a href="https://www.manager-tools.com/2019/09/event-based-peer-feedback-part-1">Event Based Peer Feedback</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nonviolent-Communication-Language-Marshall-Rosenberg/dp/1892005034">Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life</a>, by Marshall B. Rosenberg is a fantastic overview of communicating effectively about emotions.</li>
