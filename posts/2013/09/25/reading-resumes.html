        <div class="entry-content">
        <p>Tonight, I sat down and read through every resume in the 2013 SCS senior
resume book. Reading resumes for a company is really interesting, because
I find myself looking at them very differently. As a student, I didn't
really understand what sections of the resume are important. I thought
it would be interesting to give a brief walk through of my resume scan
process<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I look at the sections of the resume in roughly this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Graduation year / major.</em> I want to know if I'm dealing with a
     Sophomore/Junior/Senior so I know how to evaluate the classes
     and work experience. I also glance at the major, because there are
     a few majors that are red flags (no, I will not skip your resume
     if you are in IS. IS actually <em>isn't</em> a red flag to me, and a single
     red flag is not a veto). </p>
<ul>
<li><em>I do not care</em> about your GPA, although I will be concerned if it 
      is below at 3.2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Courses taken.</em> I want to know what experience you have and what you find
     interesting (or what you think employers will find interesting).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I want to see</em> the courses you've taken that <em>aren't</em> required or
       were an option for you. In
       particular, I am interested in seeing the 300 and 400 level courses
       you've taken (if you're a systems person, for example, I expect to
       see more than one upper level systems course). While I cannot tell
       how well you did in the courses if you don't tell me (that 
       information would actually be super useful), I hope to get
       an idea of what interests you from your choice in courses. You should
       also be aware that as a CMU graduate, I'm well of the fact that some
       courses are more difficult than others. Did you take Compilers and
       Parallel as a Junior, or are just only now taking Distributed as a
       senior? If you're a sophomore who
       hasn't taken any of these courses yet, I'm interested in seeing which
       core courses you've taken.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Projects.</em> I want to know what you've done when you had the freedom to 
     choose what to do.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I want to see</em> interesting projects you did for fun or as a 
     class final project where you got to choose what to do. </li>
<li><em>I don't want to see</em> projects required for a course where you
     had no influence on the design. I took the same courses at CMU as
     you, I am wholly unimpressed by a "web proxy" project (and am 
     actually concerned if I see that on a senior resume).</li>
<li><em>I am worried by</em> hackathon projects. This is my personal
     opinion, but I'm generally worried by projects that were intended
     to have a flashy demo and weren't designed for longevity. I want
     you to see projects that you're <em>proud</em> of and am generally
     suspicious that a 2 day project has enough interesting ideas or
     well designed code for this.</li>
<li><em>I usually find it hard to discern anything</em> from research projects. If
     you describe the interesting work the project is doing, it is
     hard to know what <em>you</em> did. Even if you describe what you did, 
     it is hard to know how much influence you had in the design
     process for the project.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, I've learned enough to identify the people I definitely want to
talk to and the people I definitely don't want to talk to. To try to sort the
people I'm still not sure about, I will look at two more pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Order of languages on your resume.</em> If you say you are a systems person but
    you put PHP ahead of C, I'm skeptical.</li>
<li><em>Other companies.</em> If I'm otherwise unsure about your resume, but you've had 
    internships at large / good companies, thats a good sign. If you haven't had
    very many / any internships, thats a bad sign. I don't really read what you
    did - I assume you were like me and were involved on a project you didn't
    have much control over that wasn't related to the core business. </li>
<li><em>Teaching assistant for 200+ level courses.</em> It is a good sign if you TA for
    a 200 level course or above (and a great sign if you TA for a 400 level
    course). There are a <em>lot</em> of 100 level TAs, so it is hard to get anything
    meaningful out of that. Also, which semesters you were a TA can be helpful.</li>
</ul>
