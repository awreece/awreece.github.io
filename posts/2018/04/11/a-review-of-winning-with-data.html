        <div class="entry-content">
        <p>On the advice of a former colleague, I recently read <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Winning-Data-Transform-Culture-Empower-ebook/dp/B01G9FLALC">Winning with Data: Transform Your Culture, Empower Your People, and Shape the Future</a> by Tomasz Tunguz and Frank Bien.</p>
<p>This book was a bunch of just-so stories about how companies used a data-driven methodology (via Looker) to improve their business. It also mixed in some unrelated stuff; e.g. how to do pitches. I found this quite underwhelming, but here were some interesting quotes.</p>
<h2>Quotes</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Brutal intellectual honesty aims to slay the HIPPO, or the highest-paid person's opinion, as the determining factor of the direction of a project, team, or company. Left unmitigated, this management artifact wreaks disastrous consequences on companies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is particularly relevant to companies that try to bring a more data driven approach to decision making and might have to counter traditional decision making. I think this was a place where there was a lot of potential for more interesting exploration: how do you convince a team to switch to a data driven culture (e.g. the old school scouts in Moneyball).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What decisions would that analysis inform?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When being asked to do some involved/length analysis, make sure the result would have real business impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Upworthy's use of attention minutes, rather than the traditional cost per thousand impressions, as a metric for charging advertisers aligns the incentives of readers, journalists, and advertisers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The use of derived measures here reminds me of the use of “risk tolerance” by the google SRE teams https://landing.google.com/sre/book/chapters/embracing-risk.html</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Z score is determined by the desired p-value / confidence interval. Let's choose an 80 percent confidence interval. The Z score is 1.28.</p>
<p>The standard of deviation is measured on a scale from 0 to 1. Most people use 0.5 since it is the most forgiving value and will generate the largest sample size.</p>
<p>The margin of error is also called the confidence interval.</p>
<p>$$ SampleSize = \frac{ZScore^2 * StandardOfDeviation * (1 -
StandardOfDeviation)}{MarginOfError^2} $$</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A convenient formula to compute required sample size for a statistically
relevant study.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their analysis showed 10 slides is the optimal length for fundraising pitches:</p>
<p><em>Company Purpose</em>: the mission or goal of the business</p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: the complication with the status quo that creates the opportunity for the business to pursue</p>
<p><em>Solution</em>: the company's proposed idea to resolve the problem</p>
<p><em>Why Now</em>: why should this idea succeed now, when no one has succeeded with it before?</p>
<p><em>Market Size</em>: if the business were to succeed, how valuable could it be?</p>
<p><em>Product</em>: typically, a demonstration of the product or images of the technology</p>
<p><em>Team</em>: the members of the founding and executive team, often including key advisors and investors</p>
<p><em>Business Model</em>: an overview of the business' pricing strategy and unit economics.</p>
<p><em>Competition</em>: a description of the alternatives and substitutes and how the startup intends to differentiate itself</p>
<p><em>Financials</em>: a pro-forma profit and loss projection of the business. In Docsend's analysis, investors spend the most time on this slide to understand the long-term profitability of the business and the amount of capital required to sustain the company.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this list of 10 slides is likely to be good for nearly any pitch, including for internal presentation.</p>
